## Extras

At this time, Nextcloud don't permit to share uploaded files with their name + extension to the link itself, feature needed sometime for services like chat, forum preview, etc..

With the Public Path feature from the plugin and a little web server configuration, you can bypass this limitation like below :


```
# Create a virtual website folder
mkdir -p /var/www/screenshots/johndoe

# Symlink you real upload account folder to this one
ls -s /var/www/nextcloud/data/johndoe/files/screenshots /var/www/screenshots/johndoe

# Create a new vhost (like apache)
vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/screenshots.domain.tld.conf

# Add primary directives and this code block

DocumentRoot /var/www/screenshots/
<Directory /var/www/screenshots/>
        Options FollowSymlinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
</Directory>

# Activate new website
a2enmod screenshots.domain.tld.conf

# Reload web server
systemctl reload apache2
```

Then access to your uploads with the new URL : https://screenshots.domain.tld/johndoe/snap_xxx.png
